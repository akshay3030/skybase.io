# Skybase Installation

There are several types of Skybase system installation:


1. Personal
2. Team scale (multi-user, single location)
3. Enterprise Scale (multi-user, multi-location )
4. Skybase Developer Installation
5. Demo (or "Try-it-Out") setup ????

The main difference between these types of installation is a location where different components of Skybase will be installed.

Note: For this initial release of the Skybase system into Open Source we did carve out the code from our internal CI/CD workflow.
At this time only the "Skybase Developer Installation" section is available.
And We are working on packaging for other types of install which will not be rely on Lithium internal processes.

## Personal Setup

Usage: Personal installation allows one person to use skybase to manage deployments into multiple clouds and control/manage 
different deployment supporting systems from a single location ( No authentication; all files and scripts are local ).
